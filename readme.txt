== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the user-interface not displaying correctly? =
Your theme's style.css might be interfering with the default css of the plugin. To customize the way the plugin is displayed in your theme either create styles overwriting the the styles called from izcalender/css/iz-calender.css or customize izcalender/css/iz-calender.css to suit your theme. 
This plugin was developed following WP best practice and will work best with themes thats developed using the same standards.
